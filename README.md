# web-scraping-challenge

In this project, I used Python code in Jupyter Notebook and MongoDB to scrape Mars data from five different websites. I copied the Python code into a scrape_mars.py Python file which is called by my Flask app Python file. I also have an index.html file that sets up the website view when app.py is running, using localhost.

The result is a web page that allows a person to click on "Scrape New Data" to retrieve the current data from those five websites.
